# Lilac - Custom Card
## How to install Custom Cards?
This method works for both PC and Mobile EDOPro, but on mobile the ***ProjectIgnis*** folder can be named ***EDOPRO***.

1. Click [here][df2] to download the file [user_config.json][df2]
2. Once the download is done, move it to the ***ProjectIgnis/configs*** folder
3. Open EDOPro and wait for the files to be downloaded

## How to use custom cards in the Deck?
All custom cards here are formatted with ***custom card EDOPro*** and therefore do not appear by default in your card catalog, to use them, you must enable the ***alternative formats*** option available in Deck editing.
